# RockPaperScissorsDOM

Welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors game which now has DOM Manipulation elements into it! Here you will find a log of my work:

Saturday 3rd April 2021 - 01:00 -> 05:00AM BST:
- Added HTML & CSS Elements for Visual Detail
- Added JavaScript in order to make the Computer select 3 array elements and for the player to choose his options.

IN PROGRESS:
- Working Score System (5 points = winner)
- Tie messages, winner/lose messages.
- Winner Screen
